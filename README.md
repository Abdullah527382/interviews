### What is this repo?

Just some practice for interview questions, mainly focussed around full stack technologies which can include:

#### Practical tests

- Databases
- Backend (OOP, Express, etc.)
- Frontend (React)

The above are usually completed on an online IDE since generating the starter code for React or Database management is generally tougher in our local; for these, we just save our final code here.

### Problem solving

- Algorithms
- Data structures and types e.g. Linked lists, BSTs and Graphs are the main focus.

For problem solving we want to focus more on typescript/Node whereas for practical we might need to use SQL, Python, Kubernetes or docker (whichever is required)
